							<h1>The Penguin race car </h1>
							<span class="image"><img src="images/Penguin.jpg" class = "verysmall" alt="" /></span>
							<p>The race car project was one of the highlights for me during my time at Imperial. Despite it being a difficult project to undergo as a sophomore engineering student who has had limited experience in mechanical transmissions and design, it was a valuable experience that I learned much from. THe skills I have attained from this project is helping me through my studies to this day.</p>
							<p>The aim of this project was to design a miniature motorised car that was subjected to a speed-race across a track of approximately 40m and a torque challenge against competing designs. In addition to its power performance, being a popular and timelss children's toy, it is also likely to be left out after a busy day of playing, and thus at risk of being stepped on. As such, one of the requirements from the client is that the car must with stand a load of 80 kg (simulating an adult stepping on it accidentally), and that all the transmission components must be contained within a rounded cover to protect the child and the parent. </p>
							<span class="image"><img src="images/Penguin1.jpg" class = "verysmall" alt="" /></span>
							<p>The biggest challenge to this project is to select the correct speed, whilst sustaining a moderate amount of torque. This means that the mechanical transmissions must deliver this requirement, and it must be carefully designed. Hence at the beginning of the project, we studied various types of flexible and rigid drives, and compiled our study in the following figure.</p>
							<span class="image"><img src="images/Penguin2.jpg" class = "small" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Finally, I would like to discuss about the shape of the penguin and how it came about. The original requirement for the team was that the outer cover must be biconcave, and in the case of our chassis, slender. After multiple trials, and by using the Fusion 360 sculpting environment, the team has created a shape which resembled a Penguin. The unique outlook fits very well with its purpose of being a popular children's toy. </p>
