							<h1>Signature Robot for knee arthoplasty (total knee replacement)</h1>
							<span class="image "><img src="images/SignatureRobot1.jpg" class="small" alt="" /></span>
							<p>In the area of orthopaedics, knee arthoplasty is known to be a necessary but difficult operation for patients suffering from severe osteoarthritis, and these surgeries are generally the last resort due to the highly invasive nature of arthroplasty. Where not only is the patient exposed to infection risks of an open surgery, but also other risks such as loosening and instability of the implant throughout its lifetime. With this rationale in mind, the Signature Robot was built to tackle some of the issues addresed here.  </p>
							<p>The robot itself is built to mount on a previous final year project which consists of a 3DoF platform with yall, pitch and rolle angle control. The aim of this project is to build a robotically controlled base that allows the surgrical tools to reach a full knee sized workspace of 50x50mm with 2DoF motion. In addition, the robot contain haptic feedback, meaning that when a prespecified boundary is exceeded, it gives a physical response countering this disturbance. </p>
							<p>Together with four other talented engineers, we built a parallel 5 bar linkage robot that allows surgeons to perform delicate small writst motions on the operating table with active constraints, just like writing a signature. We implemented the control system via an Arduino Mega, and prototyped most of the robot components in the workshop.  The robot was also designed with simplicity an precision in mind. For example, joints are securely fastened with nuts and air-tight glue which reduces backlash significantly.  </p>
							<p>As with most university projects this year, my project was also cut short due to unexpected circumstances. Thus to test the robot, we extracted the parameters from it and wrote a MATLAB application with a GUI that constructs the robot computationally and performs kinematic and dynamical calculations. With this app, the user will know exactly how much torque was exerted by the motors, and the velocity of the end effector.</p>
